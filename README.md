Small repo used to build and push docker images from the [musicbrainz-docker](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-docker) project.

Feel free to use the built images, but please note that I do not offer any support. This repository exists solely to avoid having to run expensive build steps in [mb-userscripts](https://github.com/ROpdebee/mb-userscripts)' CI.
